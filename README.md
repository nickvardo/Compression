Image data compression is a crucial step in managing and exchanging images in various applications, from data storage and transmission to real-time image processing. In this study, the performance of three fundamental image data compression algorithms, namely Huffman, LZW, and JPEG, was examined. These algorithms were evaluated based on criteria such as compression performance, image quality, and processing time. The study revealed the JPEG algorithm as the optimal choice due to its balance between image quality and compression performance. The development of an image compression tool using Python confirmed the effectiveness of this approach. Finally, proposals for future research in the field include improving the JPEG algorithm, enhancing security and privacy, and developing new algorithms specifically tailored for real-time applications.
